# MocoExtendProblem
this is an example of how to add custom Moco goals to existing matlab scripts instead of constructing an omoco file or porting your existing matlab code to c++.


## Requirements

- Download and install OpenSim from [SimTK](https://simtk.org) and follow the documentation for setting up OpenSimâ€™s MATLAB scripting environment.
- Follow the instructions (OpenSim) to download necessary dependencies for both scripting in MATLAB and C++ development.
- In MATLAB, configure MEX with mex -setup C++ to use the MS VisualStudio 2019+.

To create a new goal with `MEP`: 

1. OpenSim 4.5+ users should copy a goal in the `custom_goals` directory while 4.2-4.4 users  should copy a goal in `custom_goals_compat`.
2. Replace mentions of the original goal name to that of your new custom goal name in each of the 5 files and file names, being careful to also modify the include guards in the dll and register types header files. 
3. Reimplement constructProperties(), initializeOnModelImpl(), calcIntegrandImpl(), calcGoalImpl() such that they describe your custom goal.

To incorporate extend_problem goals into an existing MATLAB script, a C-style pointer to the instantiated MocoProblem is passed as a constructor argument to the `extend_problem.m` class that wraps the `MEP` MEX. Class methods of `extend_problem.m` are then used to add custom goals to the MocoProblem.

```C++
cptr = uint64(problem.getCPtr(problem));
ep = extend_problem(cptr);
ep.addMocoCustomGoal('custom_goal',weight,power,divide_by_distance);
```
