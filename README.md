# Summary<a name="summary"></a>

MocoExtendProblem (`MEP`) is a framework to rapidly develop novel goals for biomechanical optimal control problems using OpenSim Moco and MATLAB (The Mathworks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA). `MEP` features several templates for testing and prototyping novel MocoGoals in lieu of rebuilding OpenSim or generating an .omoco file from C++ to load the problem into MATLAB. Instead, users structure custom goals, build them, and call custom goals from MATLAB scripts.

# Setup<a name="setup"></a>
- `MEP` runs on MATLAB (tested on 2022a and above) and requires [visual studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com) as well as [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/)
- Download and install OpenSim from [SimTK](https://simtk.org) and follow the documentation for setting up OpenSimâ€™s MATLAB scripting environment.
- Follow the instructions (OpenSim) to download necessary dependencies for both scripting in MATLAB and C++ development.
- In MATLAB, configure MEX with mex -setup C++ to use the MS VisualStudio 2019+.

# Getting Started<a name="getting-started"></a>

## Compile MEX interface

From the top-level directory (`MocoExtendProblem`) there is a `build.m` script. Running this script will generate the `ExtendProblem` class and the MEX interface. NOTE: building and testing the class requires being in the top-level directory; however after the build is successful, you are free to add the `bin\relwithdebinfo` to your matlab path.

Forking and adding `MEP` as a submodule to your project and then building is the preferred method of including it to a new or existing project.

## Creating a new goal

1. OpenSim 4.5+ users should copy a goal in the `custom_goals` directory while 4.2-4.4 users  should copy a goal in `custom_goals_compat`.
2. Replace mentions of the original goal name to that of your new custom goal name in each of the 5 files and file names, being careful to also modify the include guards in the dll and register types header files. 
3. Reimplement `constructProperties()`, `initializeOnModelImpl()`, `calcIntegrandImpl()`, `calcGoalImpl()` such that they describe your custom goal.

To incorporate extend_problem goals into an existing MATLAB script, a C-style pointer to the instantiated MocoProblem is passed as a constructor argument to the `extend_problem.m` class that wraps the `MEP` MEX. Class methods of `extend_problem.m` are then used to add custom goals to the MocoProblem.

```C++
cptr = uint64(problem.getCPtr(problem));
ep = extend_problem(cptr);
ep.addMocoCustomGoal('custom_goal',weight,power,divide_by_distance);
```

# Testing<a name="testing"></a>

In the test directory, we have provided some test scripts to be run with MATLAB desktop GUI:
- `test_ExtendProblem_simple.m`
- `example2DWalking/WalkSim_Tracking.m`
- `example2DWalking/WalkSim_predictive.m`
- `driver.m`

Additionally if using an opensim version that is lower than 4.5, there are compatibility versions of `WalkSim_predictive.m` and `test_extendProblem_simple.m` to handle OpenSim version 4.2-4.4. The output of these scripts are compared against an OutputReference within the `MocoExtendProble\output` directory. Note: you should stay on the top-level directory `MocoExtendProblem`.
