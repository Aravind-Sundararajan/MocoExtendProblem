# Summary<a name="summary"></a>

MocoExtendProblem (`MEP`) is a framework to rapidly develop novel goals for biomechanical optimal control problems using OpenSim Moco and MATLAB (The Mathworks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA). `MEP` features several templates for testing and prototyping novel MocoGoals. In lieu of rebuilding OpenSim or generating an .omoco file from C++ to load the problem into MATLAB, users structure custom goals, build them, and call custom goals from MATLAB scripts.

# Setup and Requirements<a name="setup"></a>
- `MEP` was developed with Windows in mind, MacOS and linux are not supported at this time.
- `MEP`supports OpenSim versions 4.5 and has compatability for OpenSim 4.2-4.4, but does not support OpenSim versions below 4.2.
- `MEP` runs on MATLAB (tested on 2022a and above) and was tested with [visual studio 2019+](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com) as well as [CMake 3.23.3+](https://cmake.org/download/)
  
![Matlab 2022b](paper/matlab_version.png)

`MEP` was tested with cmake version 3.23.3, Matlab 2022b, and visual studio 2022 with Desktop development with C++.

![cmake](paper/cmake_version.PNG)


- be sure to use visual studio installer's modify menu to install the workload for Desktop Development with C++.
  
![visual studio 2022](paper/vs2022_cpp.png)


- Download and install an OpenSim version from 4.2-4.5 from [SimTK](https://simtk.org) and follow the documentation for setting up OpenSimâ€™s [MATLAB scripting environment](https://opensimconfluence.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/OpenSim/pages/53089380/Scripting+with+Matlab).
- Follow the instructions (OpenSim) to download necessary dependencies for both MATLAB Scripting and C++ development.
- In MATLAB, configure MEX by running `mex -setup C++` in the MATLAB command window to use MS VisualStudio 2019+.

# Getting Started<a name="getting-started"></a>

## Compile MEX interface

From the top-level directory (`MocoExtendProblem`) there is a `build.m` script. Running this script will regenerate the `ExtendProblem` class and the MEX interface. Each time any goal implementations need to be changed/updated, build.m should be run. NOTE: building and testing the class requires being in the top-level directory (`MocoExtendProblem`); however, after the build is successful, you are free to add the `bin\relwithdebinfo` to your matlab path so you can access `MEP` outside the top-level directory.

The preferred method of including `MEP` to a new or existing project is to fork and add it as a submodule to your project. This way you can add your own custom goals with version control managed within your lab.

## Creating a new goal

1. OpenSim 4.5+ users should copy and paste a goal to serve as a template in the `custom_goals` directory such as MocoActivationGoal, while 4.2-4.4 users should copy and paste a goal in `custom_goals_compat`.
2. Replace mentions of the original goal name to that of your new custom goal name in each of the 5 files and file names, being careful to also modify the include guards in the osimGoalNameDLL.h and RegisterTypes_osimGoalName.h header files. 
3. In the MocoGoalNameGoal.cpp and MocoGoalNameGoal.h, reimplement `constructProperties()`, `initializeOnModelImpl()`, `calcIntegrandImpl()`, `calcGoalImpl()` such that they describe your custom goal.

To incorporate extend_problem goals into an existing MATLAB script, a C-style pointer to the instantiated MocoProblem is passed as a constructor argument to the `extend_problem.m` class that wraps the `MEP` MEX. Class methods of `extend_problem.m` are then used to add custom goals to the MocoProblem. In your matlab script using moco, after instantiating a MocoProblem, add the following 3 lines to pass the c-style pointer to your MocoProblem to the ExtendProblem class constructor and call the addMocoGoalName method to inject your custom goal into your problem. For additional examples see the test subdirectory.

```C++
cptr = uint64(problem.getCPtr(problem));
ep = extend_problem(cptr);
ep.addMocoCustomGoal('custom_goal',weight,power,divide_by_distance);
```

## Tutorial


first clone MocoExtend Problem.
```
git clone git@github.com:Aravind-Sundararajan/MocoExtendProblem.git
```
Next, open MATLAB and run build.m to see that your setup is working.

After building, you should see the following in the command window:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2bc359da-b3f5-45a7-881b-bf6b8a8180f0)

To build a new goal, we are going to copy a goal folder to serve as a template, I'll call this new goal MocoCustomGoal.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2182699-0632-49c8-9b7a-1d395ff15239)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/96c63e1b-160b-4175-b5cb-1f299228c5f6)

We need to change the naming conventions of the 5 files (GoalName.cpp, GoalName.h, osimGoalNameDLL.h, RegisterTypes_osimGoalName.cpp, RegisterTypes_osimGoalName.h) from MocoActivationGoal to MocoCustomGoal
You can do this by hand or using an ide/editor like vscode or notepad++.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c9b46c1e-4f7a-4004-8230-c40b68cc20a7)

We also need to change the  naming conventions within each of the files. This is relatively easy to regex replace or find&replace with vscode, but also not challenging by hand either. I am going to do this with vscode. You should have 45 replacements across the 5 files. (Note I am checking the box for Preserve Case so I can change the class names and includeguards in one go.)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f75691b-d203-47b9-991a-a3816ef68d0f)

Now let's run build.m again and make sure our new MocoCustomGoal works.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ef1dc71-4a3b-4b58-8b10-7ebf3e9b1d34)

If we look in the bin/RelWithDebInfo directory, we will see that our new custom goal has been created.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31809208-2d24-4a49-a17c-2246cfa2f397)

And if we check `bin/RelWithDebInfo/extend_problem.m` you will see we have a new method for adding the MocoCustomGoal to a MocoProblem.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/61de7002-44a4-4d43-bdc6-6988eaa57b48)

Let's try adding MocoCustomGoal to a problem. Quickly we can edit `test\test_ExtendProblem_simple.m`

Comment line 81, and add a new line `ep.addMocoCustomGoal('custom_goal',1.0, true, false, false, false);` To know what the boolean arguments do, see the interface that we just lookled at (`bin/RelWithDebInfo/extend_problem.m`)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f074e409-72a2-47e4-9be9-470ae1c82af0)

Now if we hit run, and Add to Path, we should see 

```

Now feel free to modify MocoCustomGoal.cpp and MocoCustomGoal.h for new goals! For help reference the [OpenSim API reference documentation](https://simtk.org/api_docs/opensim/api_docs/index.html).

# Included Goals
- MocoActivationGoal
  * A simple MocoGoal that allows you to minimize activations, note this is not activations squared and also is not the same as the MocoControlEffortGoal which minimizes all controls.
- MocoActivationSquaredGoal
  * a slight modification to the MocoActivationGoal that squares the activations, note this is still different from the MocoControlEffortGoal that is built into Moco
- MocoBOSGoal
  * "Base of Support" goal that has the model mass center track the centroid of the base of support between the two feet.
- MocoCoordinateAccelerationGoal
  * explicit coordinate acceleration minimization, this is different from the implicit coordinate acceleration minimization that is available with Moco.
- MocoCOPGoal
  * "center of pressure" goal that has the model center of mass track the center of pressure between the two feet.
- MocoCustomOutputGoal
  * back-port of the MocoOutputGoal from 4.5 to moco 4.2-4.4 that allows you to set different exponents
- MocoMarkerAccelerationGoal
  * minimizes the cartesian acceleration of a specified marker on the model
- MocoMaxCoordinateGoal
  * smoothed approximation for maximized coordinate value, allows you to maximize or minimize a coordinate while adhering to path and endpoint constraints
- MocoMuscleStrainGoal
  * minimizes the muscle strain using a proxy for muscle volume
- MocoZMPGoal
  * "Zero-tilting Moment Point" has the model center of mass track the point projected to the floor that produces zero tilting moments
    
# Testing<a name="testing"></a>

In the test subdirectory, we have provided some test scripts to be run with MATLAB desktop GUI:
- `test_ExtendProblem_simple.m` - runs a simulation with the Max Coordinate Goal with result depicted below.
- `example2DWalking/WalkSim_Tracking.m` -runs a tracking simulation with MEP
- `example2DWalking/WalkSim_predictive.m` - runs a predictive simulation with MEP (uses the MocoTrack class with tracking weights set to zero)
- `driver.m` - a driver program for selecting the simulation type and if the simulation is tracking or predictive (for regenerating results from the Manuscript) The 3 goals investigated are the before-mentioned MocoMarkerAccelerationGoal, MocoBOSGoal, and MocoZMPGoal.

![Max Coordinate Goal](paper/MEP_point_mass_max.png)

Additionally, if using an opensim version that is lower than 4.5, there are compatibility versions of `WalkSim_predictive.m` and `test_extendProblem_simple.m` to handle OpenSim version 4.2-4.4. The output of these scripts are compared against an OutputReference within the `MocoExtendProble\output` directory. Note: you should stay on the top-level directory `MocoExtendProblem`.
